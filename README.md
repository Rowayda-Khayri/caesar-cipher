# caesar-cipher
Cryptanalysis application that's based on Caesar cipher algorithm.

The app does the following:
===========================
1- Encryption:
--------------
- Accept a plaintext  and convert it to
enciphered text according to a given (key) following Caesar cipher.

2- Decryption:
--------------
- Accept an enciphered text, following Caesar cipher and automatically analyze the letters in the enciphered text to determine their frequencies.
- Compare the frequencies with the standard English but shifted with 1, 2, 3, ... or more as expected by Caesar cipher.
- Determine the highest correlation coefficient and then the key length and automatically deciphers the message accordingly.
